# 💔 Chat with Your Ex - AI Closure Companion

## 🧠 Concept

**"Chat with Your Ex"** is an emotionally-driven AI tool that allows users to simulate conversations with their ex-partner by uploading real past chat history (e.g., WhatsApp, iMessage, Telegram). Using fine-tuned language modeling and emotional tone analysis, the AI mimics the personality, tone, and speech style of the ex for closure, nostalgia, or reflection.
